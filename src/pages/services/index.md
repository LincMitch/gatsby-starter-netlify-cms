        xAGILE COACHINGScrum Masters and Agile Coaches bring an Agile and Lean mindset coupled with a depth of skills and on the ground experiences. They help teach, mentor, coach and facilitate organisations, product owners and teams through their journey towards greater business agility.

        FACILITATION
        Facilitation is a core skill for an Agile Coach / Scrum Master. We have facilitated hundreds of workshops over many years, from Inceptions that kick off new work with large groups to Sprint Retrospectives for small agile teams.

        Facilitators provide the structure and process that help people engage and accomplish their task or goal. We stay neutral on content, drawing that from the participants.

        We create the right environment, ensuring all voices are heard, the energy and momentum is maintained and help the group in reaching consensus and making decisions. If you need help to facilitate an upcoming workshop or Agile event please reach out.

        AGILE TRAINING
        The pace of change is accelerating, people are working on complex problems and dealing with increasing uncertainty. The need to learn, adapt, innovate and deliver value sooner has never been more pressing.

        The Agile mindset and methods will help you navigate this complexity,  welcoming change and reducing your time to market. Our training gives you the knowledge you need to get started, we can also customise training specific to your organisation.

        We favour an experiential learning approach that gets the point home whilst providing a enjoyable learning experience.

        AGILE CONSULTING
        Do you need specific help with Agile that’s not covered by our other Services? You may want some specific advice, it might relate to problems you are experiencing or improvements you are seeking. Perhaps you already have Agile working well in technology with a few small teams, now you want to explore how to scale that to achieve greater business agility.

        We are here to help, our approach is to first listen to understand, remaining curious about where you are at and what is looking to happen. Together we can explore what support might be needed and how we can help.

        Alternatively you might prefer to simply catch up for a coffee and have a chat, maybe one casual conversation is all that’s needed. Get in touch, we love our coffee!
